For Project 2 : Simple Restaurant Website Login and Signup Authentication

I used Firebase as a Backend for the authentication of this project.

Replace the FireBase authentication keys as shown below with your own keys in the main project file to successfully run Project 2 with authentication 

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "yOUR_MEASSURMENT_ID"
};
